When it comes to choosing a platform for different use cases, technical capabilities play a crucial role. Let's dive into three scenarios: a decentralized app, a supply chain network among known partners, and an inter-bank financial application.

For a decentralized app, I'd choose blockchain platforms like Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric. These platforms offer decentralization, transparency, and immutability, making them perfect for applications that require trustless interactions. Smart contracts enable automation and ensure that all parties follow the rules.

For a supply chain network among known partners, Hyperledger Fabric stands out. Its private permissioned blockchain allows for controlled access and visibility, ensuring that sensitive information is only shared with authorized parties. Its scalability and performance also make it suitable for high-volume transactions.

For an inter-bank financial application, Corda is an excellent choice. Designed specifically for financial institutions, Corda provides a high level of security, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Its unique architecture ensures that transactions are only shared with relevant parties, maintaining confidentiality.

In each case, the choice of platform depends on the specific technical requirements. By understanding the strengths of each platform, we can build more efficient, secure, and scalable solutions that meet the needs of various industries.
